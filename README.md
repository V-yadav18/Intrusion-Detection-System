# Intrusion Detection System 

## Overview

This project aims to build an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a feature selection mechanism. The IDS is developed using Python, Jupyter Notebook for code development, HTML/CSS for the user interface, and JavaScript for enhancing the user experience. The project utilizes the KDD Train and Test datasets for modeling and evaluation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/intrusion-detection-project.git
   cd intrusion-detection-project
   

2. Install dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook for modeling:
   
   jupyter notebook notebooks/intrusion_detection.ipynb
   

## Data

- The project uses the KDD Train and Test datasets for intrusion detection. You can find the data in the /data directory.

## Feature Selection

- The feature selection mechanism is implemented in the Jupyter Notebook intrusion_detection.ipynb.

## Model Building

- In the Jupyter Notebook, we build and train the intrusion detection model using Python.

## Evaluation

- We evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics in the Jupyter Notebook.

## User Interface

- The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript located in the /web directory. You can access it by opening web/index.html in a web browser.

## Dependencies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
